# Chaotic-Audio-Encryption

## About the project
A Python implementation of the chaos based, real time audio encryption method proposed in the paper:
""
which is submitted to the Conference:
MOCAST 2023

The implementation offers a GUI that allows the user to encrypt audio files based on the key that they select and save the encrypted message.
Additionally, it allows the user to select encrypted audio files and decrypt them, by selecting the appropriate keys.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
<ul>
<li> PyQt6 </li>
<li> pyaudio </li>
<li> numpy </li>
<li> scipy </li>
</ul>


### Instalation
Clone the repository

 ```
  https://github.com/iokaf/Chaotic-Audio-Encryption.git
  ```

Install the requirements
 ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Run the interface

 ```
  python main.py
  ```

## Usage
The implementation offers a GUI that allows the user to encrypt audio files based on the key that they select and save the encrypted message.
Additionally, it allows the user to select encrypted audio files and decrypt them, by selecting the appropriate keys.

More explicitly, for the encryption process, the user initially selects the directory where the encrypted audio file is to be saved and the filename to be used. 
This is done by pressing the **Select Save Directory** button.
The audio file is saved in wav form.

Subsequently, the user selects the initial condition and parameter value to be used, by pressing the **Select Encryption Keys** button.

Once this is done, the user can start a recording by pressing the **Start** 
button, which starts the recording and encryption process.
The prosses continues untill the user presses the **Stop** button, which stops the recording and writes the encrypted audio file.

To decrypt a saved audio file, the user initially selects the file to be decrypted by pressing the **Select Encrypted File** button.
Subsequently, the decryption keys to be used are selected by pressing the **Select Decryption Keys** button.
Next, the path and name for the decrypted audio file is selected using the **Select Decryption Save Directory** button.
Finally, pressing the **Decrypt** button initializes the decryption process and saved the decrypted file.

## Testing

The functionality of the implementation has been tested with 
Ubuntu 20.04 and an Intel i7 processor.
Additioanlly, it was tested with Windows 10 and an Intel i5 processor.
Still, bugs may exists. 
Please feel free to report a bug or request a feature.


## Limitations
Althougth the method has been tested and works with different Operational Systems and it works, messages encrypted with one architecture may fail to be decrypted in a different one, even if the same keys are selected, due to numerical differences.
